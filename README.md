99Cats
======

99Cats is a pet project that I used in order to learn to implement some of the more common features on sites like airbnb, where uses request some window of time of some resource, and the owner of that resource can accept or deny requests. I also took the opportunity to hand-roll the user authentication system using bcrypt, and explore Bootstrap for styling.

Technologies
------------
* Ruby on Rails
* HTML/CSS

Gems
----
* bcrypt
* bootstrap

Features
--------
* add cats to your cat collection
* view requests for your cats time, and confirm or deny them
* view other cats, and make valid requests for their time (if it doesn't overlap some other accepted request)
